# news-scraper
News scraper app that uses cheerio to scrape a news site, mongodb to save news articles and comments, and express to serve the site and data.

Couple of key notes: while the main functionality is working, the styles aren't great. Also, there's javascript in handlebars, and really, it should be pulled out, but the modals weren't working properly when I tried to do this.

Also, I've tried to upload to heroku, and am having trouble with mlab-- using this for the first time. It's just some sort of weird setting/syntax issue, that I will attempt to resolve soon.

In the meantime, here's a screen recording of how things are looking: [https://youtu.be/uwgCTdXvWEg](https://youtu.be/uwgCTdXvWEg).

Phew-- busy week. Onward to react.
