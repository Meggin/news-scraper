# news-scraper
News scraper app that uses cheerio to scrape a news site, mongodb to save news articles and comments, and express to serve the site and data.

I've managed to tweak this a bit so it doesn't look horrible and the main functionality works as expected.

More could be done to inform the user, and it could be a bit flashier, but it's clean and it works all right for an MVP.

Here's a link to the app: https://pure-woodland-61367.herokuapp.com/

Phew-- busy week. Onward to react.
